 * <media:rating>

This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included, it assumes that no restrictions are necessary. It has one optional attribute.

               <media:rating scheme="urn:simple">adult</media:rating>
               <media:rating scheme="urn:icra">r (cz 1 lz 1 nz 1 oz 1 vz 1)</media:rating>
               <media:rating scheme="urn:mpaa">pg</media:rating>

               <media:rating scheme="urn:v-chip">tv-y7-fv</media:rating>
scheme is the URI that identifies the rating scheme. It is an optional attribute. If this attribute is not included, the default scheme is urn:simple (adult | nonadult).

For compatibility, a medai:adult tag will appear in the ratings as a urn:simple equiv.
